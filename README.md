## 🌟 Why This Project?

This isn’t just a clone — it's a demonstration of:

- 🧠 Real-world problem solving using React, Redux, APIs, and persistent storage
- 🧩 Component-driven development with modular UI and feature-specific logic
- 🗂️ Full-stack ready architecture — scalable, testable, and easy to maintain

Key Engineering Concepts:

- 🔁 **State persistence via Redux + Local Storage** — ensures session continuity
- 🎤 **Debounced search bar with mic input** — replicates YouTube's search UX
- 🔄 **Live chat simulation using mock polling** — mimics real-time interactivity
- 🌐 **Offline mode using IndexedDB** — watch history works even when offline
- 🧱 **Component modularity + custom hooks** — ensures clean, scalable code
- 📑 **LLD-driven development** — included `LLD_Process.txt` explains design choices

> ✅ Built with interviewers in mind — this project displays proficiency in:
>
> - UI architecture
> - API integration
> - Asynchronous data handling
> - State management with Redux Toolkit
> - User-centric design & performance optimizations
